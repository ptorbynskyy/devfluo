# Devfluo

A sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides comprehensive development workflow management with a multi-level knowledge base system. This server enables AI assistants to manage project initiatives, track decisions, maintain code patterns, and provide structured development guidance through persistent knowledge storage.

## Purpose

Devfluo is designed to maintain consistency and continuity across development sessions by providing:

- **Multi-level Memory System**: Persistent storage of project knowledge, decisions, patterns, and solutions
- **Initiative Management**: Structured approach to managing development projects with tasks, specifications, and progress tracking  
- **Knowledge Base**: Centralized repository for architecture documentation, codebase understanding, and development patterns
- **AI-Driven Prompts (commands)**: Specialized prompts for different phases of development workflow
- **Structured Development**: Enforces consistent practices through schemas and validation

## Architecture

The server implements a comprehensive knowledge management system with several key components:

### Knowledge Layers
- **Base Knowledge**: Core project architecture and codebase documentation
- **Initiatives**: Individual development projects with specifications, tasks, and progress tracking
- **Decisions**: Architecture and design decisions with rationale and context
- **Patterns**: Reusable code patterns and best practices
- **Solutions**: Problem-solution pairs for common development challenges
- **Backlog**: Prioritized list of future development items

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js â‰¥22.0.0
- npm or equivalent package manager

### Installation

#### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g devfluo
```

#### Using npx (No Installation Required)

```

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, MCP client integration, workflow examples, and configuration details, see the [Workflow Guide](./Workflow.md).

### Quick Start

1. **Install the package globally:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g devfluo
   ```

2. **Configure your MCP client** (Claude Desktop, Continue, etc.) to use this server:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "devfluo": {
         "command": "devfluo",
         "env": {
           "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project/knowledge-base"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Initialize your project** using the `project_init` tool in your MCP client

4. **Start managing your development workflow** with initiatives, tasks, and knowledge tracking
